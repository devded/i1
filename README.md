A high-fidelity cyber-physical demonstration system showing how a water treatment plant chemical dosing safety interlock defends against SCADA sensor tampering attacks. Inspired by the **February 2021 Oldsmar, Florida water treatment plant cyberattack**, in which remote adversaries manipulated sodium hydroxide (NaOH / lye) dosing from ~100 ppm to a caustic ~11,100 ppm.

## 1. Executive Summary & Physical Consequence

In water treatment, chemical dose alone means nothing without physical consequence. In drinking water distribution, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is dosed to neutralize acidity and protect piping against corrosion. However:
- **Nominal Dosage (~100 ppm):** Finished water pH stabilizes in the **Safe Band (6.5 – 8.5)**.
- **Elevated Dosage (150 – 250 ppm):** Buffer capacity is exhausted; pH enters the **Elevated Band (8.5 – 10.0)**.
- **Caustic Overdose (1,000 – 11,100 ppm):** Strong base dissociation overwhelms the water; pH climbs past **10.0 to 12.8+**, transforming tap water into a corrosive drain-cleaner capable of severe chemical burns to human skin and mucous membranes.

This system demonstrates the attack succeeding when the safety interlock is **OFF** (watching pH climb into the dangerous red band over ~20 seconds), and being actively blocked when the interlock is **ON** (where the "Ghost Line" requested dose shoots into the stratosphere while the physical actuator stays locked at the safe baseline).

## 3. The 4 Cyberattack Vectors

| # | Attack Variant | Adversary Action | Gates Bypassed | Tripped Gate | Physical Significance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Oldsmar Spike** | Primary jumps 100 &rarr; 11,100 ppm | *None* | **Hard Bound + Rate of Change + Cross-Check** | Mirrors exact 2021 Oldsmar incident. Tripped on all three layers. |
| **2** | **Single-Channel Stealth** | Primary raised moderately to 135 ppm | Rate of Change (&le;40 ppm/s)<br>Hard Bound (&le;150 ppm) | **Cross-Check (Sensor Disagreement)** | Proves why single-channel bounds fail and why independent verification is vital. |
| **3** | **Slow Ramp / Dual-Compromise** | Ramps Primary & Verification +35 ppm/s together | Cross-Check (0% diff)<br>Rate of Change (+35 &le; 40) | **Hard Bound (&gt;150 ppm)** | Strongest vector: proves that cross-checks alone are insufficient against sophisticated adversaries. The physical hard bound is the ultimate backstop. |
| **4** | **Flow Sensor Falsification** | Chemical sensors untouched; Flow reported at 15 L/s | Cross-Check (100 vs 100)<br>Rate of Change (if ramped) | **Hard Bound on Resulting PPM** | Demonstrates why the interlock verifies *physical concentration* rather than raw pump displacement commands. |

## 4. Key Design Decisions & Judge Q&A Guide

### Q1: "What stops the attacker from just calling `/interlock` and disabling the safety system?"
> **Answer:** In actual industrial critical infrastructure adhering to **IEC 61511 / ISA-84**, Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) are **physically air-gapped and hardwired** from the basic process control system (BPCS/SCADA). The safety logic runs on separate SIL-3 rated hardware (such as a Triconex or HIMA logic solver) housed in a locked physical control cabinet. The ON/OFF toggle in this dashboard is explicitly documented and styled as a **demo stand-in for a physical, key-operated selector switch on that cabinet**, not a reachable network endpoint.

### Q2: "Why not simply hold the last accepted dose indefinitely on a block?"
> **Answer (Fail-Safe Decay Rationale):** Holding the last accepted safe command is appropriate for transient anomalies or short-lived sensor dropouts. However, if the plant was already operating at an elevated dosing state (e.g. 140 ppm) when an attack commenced, holding that state indefinitely leaves the water quality near safety margins during a prolonged outage. Our interlock implements a deterministic **fail-safe decay**: after **5 consecutive blocked cycles**, the controller actively decays the dosing setpoint down toward the nominal **100.0 ppm baseline** via exponential filtering.

### Q3: "Why is the hard bound placed on resulting ppm instead of raw pump dose?"
> **Answer:** If the safety interlock only monitored pump stroke or motor RPM, an attacker who spoofed the raw water flow meter down to 15 L/s would cause a controller attempting mass balance to heavily overdose each litre of water. By evaluating the **projected resulting finished water concentration (`ppm = feed_mg_s / flow`)**, the interlock defends against both sensor spoofing and flow manipulation.

## 5. Control Room Console (shadcn/ui Dark Design)

The frontend is built with pure **HTML5, vanilla CSS custom properties, and modern JavaScript with Chart.js 4.4 + annotation plugin**. No React or build tools are required.
- **Visual Tokens:** Complete shadcn/ui token set on `:root` (`--background`, `--card`, `--primary`, `--destructive`, `--warning`, `--success`, `--border`, `--radius`).
- **One-Screen, Zero-Scrolling Layout:** Engineered for projection and presentation monitors (`height: 100vh; overflow: hidden;`).
- **Tabular Numerals:** `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on all telemetry to eliminate number jittering.
- **Fixed Y-Axes:** Scales are pinned (`pH: 6.0 - 13.5`, `Dose: 0 - 12,000`, `Sensors: 0 - 12,000`) so line spikes snap with visual drama rather than being squashed by auto-scaling.
- **The "Ghost Line" (Dose Chart):** The requested dose appears as a semi-transparent dashed red line (`#ef4444`), while the actual pump dose appears as a solid cyan line (`#38bdf8`). When blocked, the red line rockets into the stratosphere while the blue line stays flat.
- **Sustained Block Choreography:** On a safety block, the entire viewport border illuminates with a red perimeter glow (`rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.45)`) that persists for 3 seconds before smoothly decaying.

## 7. Running the Demo for Judges (3-Minute Script)

Follow this sequence for an impactful live demonstration:

1. **Nominal State (30s):**
   - Point out the dark control-room console, tabular live telemetry readouts, and the three charts.
   - Show that Primary and Verification sensor lines overlap closely around 100 ppm, pH sits safely at ~7.60 (Green Band), and the status pill shows `NOMINAL OPERATION`.
   - Point out the **SIS Key Switch** in the top center set to `ENGAGED`.

2. **The Unprotected Attack (45s):**
   - Click the **SIS Safety Interlock Switch** to toggle it **OFF** (`BYPASSED`).
   - Click **1. Oldsmar Spike (11,100 ppm)** (or run `bash scripts/attack_oldsmar.sh`).
   - Watch the requested and actual dose lines shoot together to ~11,100 ppm.
   - Watch the finished water pH climb from 7.6 through the amber zone and into the dangerous red caustic band (>10.0, reaching 12.8+). The status pill flashes `CRITICAL DANGER`.
   - Explain: *"Without an independent safety interlock, the SCADA controller trusts the tampered sensor and poisons the finished water."*

3. **The Protected Defense & The "Ghost Line" (45s):**
   - Click **↺ Reset System Simulation** and toggle the **SIS Safety Interlock Switch** back **ON** (`ENGAGED`).
   - Click **1. Oldsmar Spike (11,100 ppm)** again.
   - **Observe the Block Choreography:**
     - The screen border flashes red.
     - The status pill transitions to `DOSE BLOCKED: SENSOR_DISAGREEMENT`.
     - In the Dose Chart, the **dashed red requested dose** rockets to 11,100 ppm, while the **solid blue actual dose** remains flat at 100 ppm.
     - In the pH Chart, the water line remains completely flat and safe at 7.60.
     - In the Event Log, a red badge slides in with the exact safety gate trip reason.

4. **Layered Defense-in-Depth (60s):**
   - Click **2. Single-Channel Stealth (135 ppm)** &rarr; show it caught exclusively by channel cross-check.
   - Click **3. Slow Ramp Dual (+35 ppm/s)** &rarr; show both channels ramping together, defeating cross-check and rate-of-change, but stopped cold by the 150 ppm hard ceiling.
   - Click **4. Flow Falsification (15 L/s)** &rarr; show that manipulating flow to trick the controller is blocked because the interlock checks physical concentration.
